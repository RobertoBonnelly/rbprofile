        <p>Who is Roberto?</p>
        
        <div>I have always been a very curious person, with a special affinity for biology. Since very early, I realized I wanted to make a living of making discoveries for everyone to apply for their institutions, which I believe came from the curiosity itself, from the need of going deep into the roots of my questions, rather than taking the shallow answer. Over the years, I have developed the believe that we should wait until, at least, 25 to choose a career, but at the age I was supposed to, I decided to study biotechnology, a new program that had opened in the country just a year before my high school graduation, this decision involved, not only jumping into an immature program, but also moving out of my town.</div>

        <p>Why did I do that?</p>

        <div>I wanted to actually get out of my comfort zone: a whole new city, where I knew no one and would have to build relationships and a life by myself, forcing myself into a hard and long mental work. After getting my bachelor's degree in biotechnology, I got the chance to work with Sars-Cov-2, where I also exposed myself to deeper programming knowledge, and woke up my interest in computation.</div>

        <div>After this, I decided to enrol into the Data Scientist course of datacamp, as well as my Master in Science of Bioinformatics.</div>

        <p>And now, what?</p>

        <div>I want a data science or full-stack role, where I can gain more depth in my computation knowledge and eventually, apply it on a PhD project about drug design.</div>
